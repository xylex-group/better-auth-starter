# 🔐 Better Auth Starter Template

This template provides a simple, ready-to-use authentication server as a starting point for your app. Build your own reliable auth server while maintaining full ownership of your data without proprietary restrictions.

## ✨ Features
- 📧 Email and password login and registration
- 🍎 Apple ID login (Sign in with Apple)
- 🩺 Healthcheck endpoint
- 📚 OpenAPI plugin enabled
- 💾 Session storage in Redis
- ⚡ Built with Hono.js for lightning-fast performance
- 📦 Compiles to a single Bun binary for easy deployment

## 🔧 Setup

Required environment variables:
- `REDIS_URL` - Connection string for Redis
- `DATABASE_URL` - Connection string for your database
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` - Secret key for encryption and security

Optional environment variables (for Apple ID login):
- `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` - Apple Service ID (Client ID)
- `APPLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Apple client secret (JWT token)

## 💡 Considerations
- 🔄 I strongly encourage **FORKING THIS REPO** and modifying the config to suit your needs, add other providers, email sending, etc.
- 🗄️ You can use the same DB for your app and this auth server, just be careful with the migrations. This enables you to directly interact with the users and auth tables from your main application.
- 🔌 You can use the endpoints directly or use better-auth on the client side and [set the base URL in the config file (highly recommended)](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/installation#create-client-instance).
